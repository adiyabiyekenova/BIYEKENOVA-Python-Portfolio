# BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my **Python Portfolio**! This repository serves as a collection of my Python-based projects for the Elements of Computing class in Spring 2025 semester.

---

## Repository Purpose üìå
This portfolio showcases my:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) knowledge and implementation
- Data visualizations and storytelling
- Implementation of advanced Python libraries and frameworks

Each project in this repository is aimed at demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## Organization üóÇÔ∏è
My Python Portfolio consists of the 4 main projects each with its own folder with the code and a very brief description below. Feel free to explore any of the projects by reading their brief introduction below and explooring the specific folders. 
1. My First Streamlit App
2. Tidy Data Project
3. Custom Named Entity Recognition App
4. Investment Insights App

## My First Streamlit App üåü
This project includes my **first Streamlit app** that displays a sample dataset and allows interactive filtering options. You can find the app inside the [basic-streamlit-app folder](basic-streamlit-app). 

### What the App Does

### Why It Matters 

### How It Complements My Portfolio 

### Instructions

## Tidy Data Project üìä

This project applies the principles of **tidy data** to clean, reshape, and visualize datasets. The project focuses on structuring data to ensure:
- Each variable has its own column.
- Each observation is in its own row.
- Different types of data are stored in separate tables.

You can find the project inside the [TidyData-Project folder](https://github.com/adiyabiyekenova/BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project).

### Why It Matters  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with raw data, perform transformations, and create meaningful visualizations. By applying data cleaning techniques, I showcase my proficiency in Python and libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

### How It Complements My Portfolio  
- Strengthens my **data wrangling** and **visualization** skills.  
- Aligns with my focus on **business analytics** and **computing**.  
- Enhances my ability to **prepare raw datasets for real-world applications**.

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `TidyData-Project` folder.
2. Read the initial README page.
3. Launch and run the Jupyter notebook.

**Feel free to explore and learn from the project!**

## Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App üß†

This interactive web app lets users define their own **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** rules and apply them instantly to any text. Built with **spaCy** and **Streamlit**, the app offers a no-code interface to experiment with NER by adding patterns, analyzing text, and visualizing detected entities.

You can find the full project inside the [NERStreamlitApp](https://github.com/adiyabiyekenova/BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp) folder.

### What the App Does
- Accepts custom text or `.txt` file uploads.
- Lets users create and manage custom entity labels and patterns.
- Applies those patterns to text using spaCy‚Äôs `EntityRuler`.
- Displays results through interactive visualizations and clean summaries.

### Why It Matters

This project demonstrates my understanding of **Natural Language Processing** concepts, particularly how to fine-tune spaCy pipelines for domain-specific needs. It shows that I can go beyond using pre-trained models and create tools that bridge user needs with complex NLP frameworks ‚Äî all through a simple and intuitive UI.

### How It Complements My Portfolio

- **Expands my NLP skill set** by showing I can work with rule-based and customizable text processing techniques.
- **Highlights my frontend/backend integration** skills with Streamlit and spaCy.
- **Reinforces my interest in building human-centered tools** that make advanced technology accessible to non-technical users.
- **Aligns with my interdisciplinary focus** on computing and business analytics by tackling unstructured text data ‚Äî a growing need across industries.

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `TidyData-Project` folder.
2. Read the initial README page.
3. Launch and run the Jupyter notebook.

**Feel free to explore the app and test it with your own text!**
