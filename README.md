# BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio
A collection of my Python-based projects and analyses for the Elements of Computing class in Spring 2025 semester.

Welcome to my **Python Portfolio**! This repository serves as a collection of my Python-based projects for the Elements of Computing class in Spring 2025 semester.

---

## Repository Purpose üìå
This portfolio showcases my:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Data visualizations and storytelling
- Predictive modeling and machine learning projects
- Implementation of advanced Python libraries and frameworks

Each project in this repository is aimed at demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## Organization Plan üóÇÔ∏è
I plan to organize the repository as follows:
1. **EDA**: Projects focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Visualizations**: Notebooks with insightful data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
3. **Models**: Machine learning and deep learning projects using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
4. **Scripts**: Reusable Python scripts for data preprocessing, utility functions, and automation.
5. **Case Studies**: End-to-end projects addressing real-world business problems.

## My First Streamlit App üåü
This project includes my **first Streamlit app** that displays a sample dataset and allows interactive filtering options. You can find the app inside the [basic-streamlit-app folder](basic-streamlit-app). 

To run it, simply follow these instructions:

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `basic-streamlit-app` folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
