# BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio
A collection of my Python-based projects and analyses for the Elements of Computing class in Spring 2025 semester.

Welcome to my **Python Portfolio**! This repository serves as a collection of my Python-based projects for the Elements of Computing class in Spring 2025 semester.

---

## Repository Purpose üìå
This portfolio showcases my:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Data visualizations and storytelling
- Predictive modeling and machine learning projects
- Implementation of advanced Python libraries and frameworks

Each project in this repository is aimed at demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

---

## Organization Plan üóÇÔ∏è
I plan to organize the repository as follows:
1. **EDA**: Projects focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Visualizations**: Notebooks with insightful data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
3. **Models**: Machine learning and deep learning projects using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
4. **Scripts**: Reusable Python scripts for data preprocessing, utility functions, and automation.
5. **Case Studies**: End-to-end projects addressing real-world business problems.

## My First Streamlit App üåü
This project includes my **first Streamlit app** that displays a sample dataset and allows interactive filtering options. You can find the app inside the [basic-streamlit-app folder](basic-streamlit-app). 

To run it, simply follow these instructions:

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `basic-streamlit-app` folder.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py

## Tidy Data Project üìä

This project applies the principles of **tidy data** to clean, reshape, and visualize datasets. The project focuses on structuring data to ensure:
- Each variable has its own column.
- Each observation is in its own row.
- Different types of data are stored in separate tables.

You can find the project inside the [TidyData-Project folder](https://github.com/adiyabiyekenova/BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project).

### Why It Matters  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with raw data, perform transformations, and create meaningful visualizations. By applying data cleaning techniques, I showcase my proficiency in Python and libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

### How It Complements My Portfolio  
- Strengthens my **data wrangling** and **visualization** skills.  
- Aligns with my focus on **business analytics** and **computing**.  
- Enhances my ability to **prepare raw datasets for real-world applications**.

### Instructions:
1. Navigate to the `TidyData-Project` folder.
2. Read the initial README page.
3. Launch and run the Jupyter notebook.

### Importance for My Future Career  
1. It is a requirement for the **Elements of Computing** class and will contribute to my grade.
2. Prepares me to understand the principles of tidy data and apply them in real-world projects.
3. Provides insight into **visualization** techniques and working with **pivot tables**.
4. Marks one of my first fully independent projects, demonstrating my ability to handle data cleaning and analysis.

**Feel free to explore and learn from the project!**
