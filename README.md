# BIYEKENOVA-Python-Portfolio
A collection of my Python-based data science projects and analyses.

Welcome to my **Python Portfolio**! This repository serves as a collection of my Python-based projects in the field of data science, analytics, and machine learning.

---

## Repository Purpose üìå
This portfolio showcases my:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Data visualizations and storytelling
- Predictive modeling and machine learning projects
- Implementation of advanced Python libraries and frameworks

Each project in this repository is aimed at demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

---

## Organization Plan üóÇÔ∏è
I plan to organize the repository as follows:
1. **EDA**: Projects focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Visualizations**: Notebooks with insightful data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
3. **Models**: Machine learning and deep learning projects using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
4. **Scripts**: Reusable Python scripts for data preprocessing, utility functions, and automation.
5. **Case Studies**: End-to-end projects addressing real-world business problems.
