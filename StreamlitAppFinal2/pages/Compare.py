Welcome to the **Company Comparison Tool**!  
Here, you can compare **two companies side-by-side** using key financial metrics.

You can choose from the following companies:
- **Apple (AAPL)**
- **Microsoft (MSFT)**
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)**

### üìò What You'll See:
We compare three major financial metrics from the Excel file:
- **Market Cap**: Total value of a company‚Äôs shares.
- **P/E Ratio (trailingPE)**: How much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.
- **Dividend Yield**: Income returned to shareholders as a percentage.

Let's get started!
