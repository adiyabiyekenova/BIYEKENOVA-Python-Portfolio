Welcome to the **Company Comparison Tool**!  
Here, you can compare **two companies side-by-side** using key financial metrics.

This tool is perfect for:
- ðŸ“Š Investors deciding between two stocks  
- ðŸ“š Students learning how to evaluate businesses  
- ðŸ¤” Anyone curious about how companies stack up financially

### ðŸ“˜ What You'll See:
We compare three major financial metrics:
- **Market Cap**: Total value of a companyâ€™s shares. A quick snapshot of company size.
- **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: Tells you how much investors are paying for $1 of company earnings. A high P/E can mean high growth expectationsâ€”or overvaluation.
- **Dividend Yield**: Shows how much a company pays back to shareholders (as a percentage of its stock price). Ideal for income-focused investors.

# Creating two input columns for the user to enter the ticker symbols of the companies 
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    ticker1 = st.text_input("First Company Ticker (e.g., AAPL)").upper()  # Input for first company's ticker symbol, converting input to uppercase
with col2:

# If both ticker symbols are entered 
if ticker1 and ticker2:
